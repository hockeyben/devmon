# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-03)

**Core value:** Coding should feel rewarding — every terminal session fuels progression in a creature-collection game that makes productive development addictive without ever blocking real work.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (foundation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 5
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-04-04

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: —
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: none yet
- Trend: —

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01-foundation P01 | 20 | 2 tasks | 16 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Architecture: Six-layer synchronous system — Shell Bridge → CLI → Event Bus → Domain Systems → Game State → Persistence. Domain systems must never import from commands/ or render/.
- Shell hooks: Never spawn Python from hook. Write raw event to log file; process backlog on next devmon invocation.
- Phase 2 research flag: bash-preexec + Starship load order is the highest-risk integration — validate against bash-preexec issue tracker before implementation.
- Creature design: 25 creatures is a significant creative workload. Plan time for content production, not just code.
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Typer app.callback() pattern required when no_args_is_help=True with zero subcommands — avoids RuntimeError on --help
- [Phase 01-foundation]: hatchling used as build backend (plan spec) instead of uv init default uv_build

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 6 depends partially on Phase 7 (party lead creature must exist). Phase 7 is listed after Phase 6 in execution order. Resolution: Phase 6 implementation will bootstrap a default party lead creature from the creature roster so battles can function; full party management (Phase 7) refines this.
