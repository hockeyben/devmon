# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-03)

**Core value:** Coding should feel rewarding — every terminal session fuels progression in a creature-collection game that makes productive development addictive without ever blocking real work.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-04-03 — Roadmap created, all 68 requirements mapped across 10 phases

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Architecture: Six-layer synchronous system — Shell Bridge → CLI → Event Bus → Domain Systems → Game State → Persistence. Domain systems must never import from commands/ or render/.
- Shell hooks: Never spawn Python from hook. Write raw event to log file; process backlog on next devmon invocation.
- Phase 2 research flag: bash-preexec + Starship load order is the highest-risk integration — validate against bash-preexec issue tracker before implementation.
- Creature design: 25 creatures is a significant creative workload. Plan time for content production, not just code.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 6 depends partially on Phase 7 (party lead creature must exist). Phase 7 is listed after Phase 6 in execution order. Resolution: Phase 6 implementation will bootstrap a default party lead creature from the creature roster so battles can function; full party management (Phase 7) refines this.
